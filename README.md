# Project 1, TMA4180 Optimization 1

In this project we answer some theoretical questions, before we implement various optimization algorithms to solve an unconstrained optimization problem.

TMA4180___Optimering____Prosjekt_1.pdf: 
- Contains the answers to the project. 

q4.py: 
- Contains function evaluations with derivatives for ellipse equations, the problems we are to solve.

Task3.py:
- classify_by_ellipse: Function to classify points based on whether they are inside/outside ellipse. 
- classify_by_rectangle: Function to classify points based on whether they are inside/outside rectangle. 
- classify_misclassification: Function to classify points based on whether they are inside/outside ellipse, but with a misclassification rate. 
- Some functions to plot points with class labels and class boundaries. 

q5_version2.py: 
- Backtracking linesearch algorithm. 
- Steepest descent algorithm.
- Fletcher-Reeves algorithm. 
- BFGS algorithm. 
- Some plotting functions that defines problems, uses the algorithms above to solve them, and plots solutions.
